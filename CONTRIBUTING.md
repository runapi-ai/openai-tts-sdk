Thanks for improving OpenAI TTS API SDK.

Before opening a pull request, run the checks for the language package you changed. Java changes should pass `./gradlew --no-daemon test publishToMavenLocal` from the `java/` directory.

Public examples should use environment variables for credentials and link to RunAPI model pages for pricing, rate limits, and usage details.
